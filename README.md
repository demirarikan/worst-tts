## Worlds worst TTS
Turkish is a mostly [phonemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonemic_orthography) langugage. Which means, theoretically, that pronouncing the 
individual letters of a word should yield the correct pronunciation of the word itself.

With this in mind, I created the worlds worst Turkish TTS (text to speech). Basically, it is a glorified spelling bee robot, amazing!

### Installation and usage
Install pygame and PySide6 using pip
Run tts_widget.py
Type whatever you want in the text field and click the speak button when you're ready!
